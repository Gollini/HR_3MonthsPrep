"""
Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play.
She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game.
Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.
Given the scores for a season, determine the number of times Maria breaks her records for most and least points scored during the season.
